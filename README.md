This is a very simple calculator, written only to kill spare time (while the Corona virus is having the time of its life)...

## Written with:
- React \w Hooks + [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
- [Semantic-UI-React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/)

## Tested with:
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io)
- [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/)
- [@testing-library](https://testing-library.com) libraries

### Still to do (Feel free to add requests):
- Deal with decimal numbers
- Show calculations history
- Save history only for logged users
- Integration + E2E tests
